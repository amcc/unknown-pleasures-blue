# unknown-pleasures-blue

The album cover for Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures. The original image was from a drawing of a pulsar signal published in Scientific American, [Pop Culture Pulsar: Origin Story of Joy Divisionâ€™s Unknown Pleasures Album Cover]: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/.

I've made a recreation of the album cover that animates here: http://amcc.github.io/unknown-pleasures, however I thought I should also use the original colour from the publication and make it respond to sound.
